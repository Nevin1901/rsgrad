## rsgrad

## WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT YET COMPLETED

micrograd but in rust

written by following Andrej Karpathy's tutorials.

## todo

- cuda support
- implement algorithms
- f16 support using the [half](https://github.com/starkat99/half-rs) crate

## why?

- fun to rewrite it in rust
- might be faster than python
- for projects, you can have compiled binaries rather than python code (eg: imagine stable diffusion as a binary instead of needing to install all the libraries)
- wasm support?
